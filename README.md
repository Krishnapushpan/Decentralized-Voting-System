# Decentralized-Voting-System
# Abstract
A decentralized voting system allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof decision-making
processes using blockchain technology.Votes are stored on a decentralized blockchain, preventing
alteration or manipulation by any single entity.Results are publicly verifiable by all participants,
ensuring complete transparency.Voters authenticate securely through decentralized identities,
minimizing the risk of voter fraud and identity theft.Blockchain ensures that votes cannot be altered
or deleted, maintaining the integrity of the voting process.
