# Decentralized-Voting-System
# Abstract
A decentralized voting system allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof decision-making
processes using blockchain technology.Votes are stored on a decentralized blockchain, preventing
alteration or manipulation by any single entity.Results are publicly verifiable by all participants,
ensuring complete transparency.Voters authenticate securely through decentralized identities,
minimizing the risk of voter fraud and identity theft.Blockchain ensures that votes cannot be altered
or deleted, maintaining the integrity of the voting process.
## Key Features
- **Decentralized Voting**: Allows users to cast their votes securely on the blockchain.
- **Transparent Results**: Election results are stored on the blockchain and are publicly verifiable.
- **Secure Authentication**: Voters authenticate securely using their Ethereum wallet to prevent fraud.
- **Tamper-Proof**: Once votes are cast, they cannot be altered, ensuring integrity in the voting process.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Web3 Library**: ethers.js
- **Wallet**: MetaMask for connecting to the Ethereum network

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MetaMask extension or another Ethereum-compatible wallet
- A local Ethereum node or use the Rinkeby testnet for testing

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Decentralized-Voting-System/VoteApp.git
    cd VoteApp
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the React frontend:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Deploy the Smart Contract

1. **Write and Compile the Smart Contract:**
   Copy the smart contract in Solidity and compile it using a framework like Hardhat.

2. **Deploy the Contract to the Ethereum Network:**
   Use Hardhat to deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum network (local or testnet).

   - **Install Hardhat:**
     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev hardhat
     ```

   - **Compile the contract:**
     ```bash
     npx hardhat compile
     ```

   - **Deploy using:**
     ```bash
     npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
     ```

3. **Get the Deployed Contract Address and ABI:**
   After successful deployment, you will receive the contract address and ABI. Save these values, as they will be required for interacting with the contract in your DApp.

4. **Configure the Contract in the Project:**
   Use the contract address and ABI in your project (e.g., in a configuration file) to interact with the deployed contract.

### Set Up MetaMask

1. **Install the MetaMask Browser Extension:**
   Go to [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) and install the extension for your preferred browser.

2. **Connect MetaMask to the Ethereum Network:**
   Open MetaMask and connect it to the Ethereum network (either local or a testnet like Rinkeby).

3. **Import or Create an Account in MetaMask:**
   Create a new MetaMask wallet or import an existing one. Follow the instructions provided by MetaMask.

### Interact with the DApp
Once MetaMask is connected to the network and the wallet is set up, you can interact with the DApp on the Ethereum blockchain.
